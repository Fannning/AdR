## Data cars

The data *cars* from R package `datasets` gives the ***speed of cars (mph)*** and the ***distances taken to stop (ft)***. All 50 observations were recorded in the 1920s.

```{r load package}
library(datasets)
data("cars")
```

Here's the first 5 observations.

```{r show the data}
head(cars)
```

## Plot

```{r plot}
#plot the data, x for speed, y for distance
plot(cars$speed,cars$dist, xlab = "Speed of Cars (mph)", ylab = "Distances Taken to Stop (ft)",main = "distances taken to stop for different car speeds")
```

From the plot, it's clear that when the car going ***faster***, it tends to take ***longer*** distance to stop.
